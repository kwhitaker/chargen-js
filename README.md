# Laybrinth Lord Character Generator
A straight-forward character generator for the [Labyrinth Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_Lord) RPG. I just chose LL because it was easy (and free) for me to get the source materials.

## Scope
This generator is intentionally limited in scope. This was mostly a way for me to play around with some
libraries and technology, and I don't know how much work I'll be doing on it after I launch it. That being said, I've built in a lot of functionality which is currently not being used, and could be added.

## Things Which Could be Added/Fixed

[ ] Fix `//$FlowFixMe` areas. These seem to be related to the ramda typings and potential empty return values.
[ ] Add ability to generate characters of arbitrary levels. The data code is there, but not the UI.
[ ] Pick equipment for generated characters.
[ ] Clean-up other areas of the code which I know need some love.
[ ] Get a real fav-icon.
[ ] Write Jest component tests.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
