# OSR Character Generator
A straight-forward character generator for the [Labyrinth Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_Lord) RPG.  Depending on how things go, I might add options
to build characters for other old-school RPGs. I just chose LL because it was easy (and free) for me to get the source materials.

## Warnings
This is a sandbox project I'm using to play with and learn some things.  The _plan_ is to build this in JSX (something I know pretty well), and then
replicate it in other languages or frameworks.  As such, anything here is subject to change without warning.  I'll be good and subscribe to semver,
but I'm not making any promises that its going to be maintained or updated regularly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
